i)This sepcial character is Control-C (often denoted  ^C)
ii)Each 6 corresponds to user's, group's and other's file
permission of this folder.6 converts to binary is 110,
110 means this file can read, write and cannot execute.
Neither the user,the group and others can execute the file.
So this means whenever one type cd csci2132,the system
denied people from entering it.Suppose we only want the
user to execute the file we can change 110 to 111,
which means the user can now perform the cd csci2132
successfully.
Ex command: $chmod 766 csci2132.
